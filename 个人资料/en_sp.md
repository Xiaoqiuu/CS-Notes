  Today, I am delighted to share with you a fascinating journey into the world of Loongson Technology and its remarkable product, the 3A2000 chip.

> 时间倒回上世纪60年代初，我国非常重视计算机的发展。1958年，我国成功研制了103机，这标志着我国的计算机研发水平正在提高。我国的计算机水平在努力地与世界逐渐缩短差距。然而，由于薄弱的基础，到了70年代，我国的半导体行业无法做出重大的突破。

In the early 1960s, China attached great importance to the development of computers. In 1958, China successfully developed the 103 computer, marking the improvement of Chinese computer research and development level. China was striving to gradually narrow the gap with the world in computer technology. However, due to a weak foundation, our semiconductor industry failed to make major breakthroughs in the 1970s.

> 美国生产的电脑，虽然大大加速了我国计算机的普及，但是采用中国芯片的计算机，似乎成为了遥远的梦想。

At that time, Computers produced in the United States greatly accelerated the popularization of computers in China,but the use of computers with Chinese chips seemed to be a distant dream.

> 2001年，在计算机研究所工作的李国杰，申请了100万资金准备挑战中国产芯片的研发。大家都知道这是不可能完成的事情，但是他仍然坚持这项任务。

In 2001, Li Guojie, who was working at the Computer Research Institute, applied for a grant of 1 million yuan to challenge the research and development of China-made chips. Although everyone knew it was an impossible task, he still persevered with this mission.

> 时年32岁的胡伟武，在他的导师夏培肃的教导下，也勇敢地挑起了这个重任。最终，在2001年夏天，这个为国奋斗的团队成功研制了“龙芯一号”，虽然性能不足，但是却标志着我们再次拥有了中国芯片。

At the age of 32, Hu Weiwu, under the guidance of his mentor Xia Peisu, also bravely took on this important task. Finally, in the summer of 2001, this team successfully developed their first chip, "Godson-1". Although its performance was insufficient, It signified that we once again had our own Chinese chips.

> 紧接着，他们研制出了龙芯2号，龙芯3号。我这里有一个带有龙芯3a2000的主板，现在展示给大家。

After that, they developed Dragon Core 2 and Dragon Core 3.Now I have a motherboard with Loongson 3a2000, which I will now show you.

> 正式从龙芯3a2000这颗芯片开始，龙芯公司拥有了自己的cpu架构指令集，这意味着不用再害怕美国的技术封锁了。

Starting from the Loongson 3a2000 chip, Loongson Corporation has its own CPU architecture instruction set, which means there is no need to be afraid of US technology lockdowns anymore.

第一，

> 第二，学会打破现状，敢于突破自我。即使中国的芯片行业收到美国的支持，但是龙芯公司依然完成了它的使命，做出了自己的中国芯片。我认为敢于突破的精神值得我们学生去学习和具备的。

Second, learn to break the current situation and dare to transcend yourself. Even though China's chip industry received support from the United States, Godson Company still fulfilled its mission and created its own Chinese chips. I believe that the spirit of daring to make breakthroughs is worth learning and possessing for us students.

第三，在座的各位都是学习计算机这门课程的，因此大家应该学习更多的关于计算机的基础知识。我们现在课上所学的内容都是基于微软平台而实践的。正如龙芯公司的胡博士所说，大学不应该继续成为微软的培训班了，要教中国自己的产品使用才能让中国的计算机产业更加进步。

最后，向为中国计算机做出卓越贡献的先驱们致敬。我的演讲到此结束，谢谢大家。
